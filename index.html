  <h1>Souro says</h1>
  <p><em>Things will go tough and get even harder as time advances. Life will be riddled with lies, you'll feel just to sit at home all day long. But remember,<strong>That you're strong.Stronger than the problems you face.</strong>The wheel always rotates. Good times will come as surely as the bad times does. you'll have to be patient, and I trust you with this. Remember your reasons, your goals, and the people who stood by you when time was hard. And it'sgonna be fine, my sunflower!! Don't let anyone else shadow your brightness!❤️ And do know one thing, trusting someone is never your fault. Since when is trusting someone a bad thing? It is the fault of the other person if they don't know the importance of keeping someone's trust. So, there is no need to be hard on yourself. You were a simple soul who wanted to love and be loved, and you're very pure hearted. Just that the partner waas not the one who it should've been, but it's okay! KOI NAA!! You are enough yourelf to stay happy...ik you might think it's impossible, but it's the truth❤️❤️❤️❤️And in the end, I've always got your back!!</em></p>
